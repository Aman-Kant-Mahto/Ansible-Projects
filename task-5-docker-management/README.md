# 🐳 Docker Management using Ansible

## 🔹 Introduction
Managing Docker containers manually can be cumbersome, especially when running multiple environments. You need a way to **start, stop, and configure containers consistently**.  

Ansible simplifies this by providing modules to manage Docker containers directly. This task shows how to:  
- Start and stop containers  
- Run specific images  
- Manage containerized applications across environments  

With this, teams can **automate container operations**, making container management **faster, repeatable, and more reliable**.

## 📌 Key Highlights
- Automates **Docker container lifecycle** (start/stop/run)  
- Ensures **consistent containerized environments**  
- Works well with **CI/CD pipelines and microservices**
