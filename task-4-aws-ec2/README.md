# ☁️ Launching AWS EC2 Instances with Ansible

## 🔹 Introduction
Manually creating cloud instances in AWS requires multiple steps — logging into the console, configuring settings, and provisioning resources. This becomes inefficient when **scaling infrastructure on demand**.  

This task demonstrates how to use Ansible to **automatically launch and configure AWS EC2 instances**. With just a few lines of code, you can spin up servers, install required software, and manage them efficiently.  

This approach saves time, reduces errors, and provides **infrastructure as code (IaC)** for cloud environments.

## 📌 Key Highlights
- Automates **AWS EC2 provisioning**  
- Uses Ansible modules for **cloud resource management**  
- Ensures **scalable and repeatable deployments**  
- Can integrate with **Terraform or CI/CD pipelines**
