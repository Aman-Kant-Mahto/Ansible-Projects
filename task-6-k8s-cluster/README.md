# ☸️ Kubernetes/OpenShift Cluster Setup with Ansible

## 🔹 Introduction
Setting up Kubernetes or OpenShift clusters manually requires significant effort — configuring nodes, installing dependencies, and managing networking.  

This task demonstrates how **Ansible automates the creation of a Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster**.  
By using playbooks, we can provision nodes, install components, and configure the cluster with minimal manual steps.  

This ensures a **reliable, consistent, and production-ready cluster setup**.
