# 🌐 Website Deployment using Ansible

## 🔹 Introduction
Traditionally, deploying a website involves **manual setup of operating systems, installing web servers, and configuring applications**. This process is slow, error-prone, and difficult to scale.  

This project demonstrates how **Ansible automates website deployment end-to-end**:
- Provisioning the operating system  
- Installing and configuring Apache Webserver  
- Pulling source code directly from GitHub  
- Making the site available instantly  

By using Ansible, you can launch **reproducible and consistent web environments** in just minutes, saving both time and effort.
